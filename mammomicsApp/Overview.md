### Overview
The Mamomics project is an NCI initiative to characterize transplantable mouse cell line models of breast cancer.  On this site, both raw and processed data are available, along with links to public repositories housing genomics data.

### Background
The Mamomics initiative arose out of a recognition of several important challenges in breast cancer research:

* Mortality in human breast cancer patients is generally a result of metastasis but relatively few models of metastatic disease are available.
* The immune system plays a key role in shaping cancer progression and response to therapy but many models involve studying human cells in immunodeficient mouse hosts.
* Few genetically-engineered mouse (GEM) models of breast cancer develop metastases at high incidence and in a time-frame that is amenable to drug-screening.

To address these issues we at the Lab of Cancer Biology and Genetics, NCI, have assembled a panel of transplantable mouse cell line models of breast cancer.  This panel is enriched for models that metastasize and represents an experimental platform that is complementary to existing human xenograft and autochthonous GEM models. Here we will share our "omics" and clinicopathologic data on these models in the hope that this information may be of use to other investigators in the field.

The Mamomics panel [dataset summary spreadsheet](https://www.synapse.org/Portal.html#!Synapse:syn3519236) lists the complete set of models and gives some information about their origin or source.  PMIDs for relevant references are also included.  However, there is currently no single source for all the models.  Anyone interested in these models will need to contact the investigators that we originally got the lines from (listed in the table).  Some of the lines were derived from spontaneously-arising tumors and others were derived from genetically engineered mice (GEM).

### Data
Data, both raw and processed, are available in the [Files tab](https://www.synapse.org/Portal.html#!Synapse:syn3522722).
